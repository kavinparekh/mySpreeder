# mySpreeder
A customised version of http://www.spreeder.com

Spreeder is a really good tool for speed reading. I have built a custom algorithm over its idea to suit to my personal requirements.

One of the problems with spreeder is that enabling it to set the screen time of a word as function of the length of the word, makes the screen time of shorter words much lesser than what I was confortable with. So I have kept a minimum threshold for all words irrespective of their length.

Sometimes when we have to pause reading for a minute or so, we lose track of our progress and need to go through the original text to regain context.So I keep a history of the recent text read in the footer.
